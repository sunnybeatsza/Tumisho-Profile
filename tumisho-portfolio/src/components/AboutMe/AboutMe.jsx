            I am a young, vibrant, and creative individual looking to break into
            the tech industry as a software developer. I'm currently looking to
            venture into full stack or mobile development but eventually, I
            would like to venture into game development and virtual reality. I
            love gaming, music, and all things tech. I hope to be a great asset
            to whichever organization I join.
